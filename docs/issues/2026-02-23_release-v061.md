# Release v0.6.1

- **Date**: 2026-02-23
- **Status**: `in_progress`
- **Branch**: `fix/2026-02-23-scan-http-polish`
- **Priority**: `medium`

## Problem

The fixes merged in PR #61 are ready, but users cannot install them via `uvx mcp-tap@...` or
`npx mcp-tap` until a new version is published.

## Context

- Current published version: `0.6.0`
- Release flow is tag-driven via `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (`v*` tags)
- PyPI version comes from `pyproject.toml`; npm wrapper version should stay aligned

## Root Cause

No new release/tag exists yet for the patch fixes after v0.6.0.

## Solution

- [ ] Linter passes: `ruff check src/ tests/`
- [ ] Tag/release `v0.6.1` created
