# Release v0.6.9 (GitHub Maturity Fallback + Transparency)

- **Date**: 2026-02-25
- **Issue**: #112
- **Status**: `in_progress`
- **Branch**: `fix/2026-02-25-release-v069`
- **Priority**: `high`

## Problem

PR #111 is merged in `main`, but no package release has been cut yet. Users cannot consume the new GitHub maturity fallback/transparency behavior from registries.

## Context

- Current version in `main`: `0.6.8`
- PR #111 introduced improvements in GitHub metadata auth fallback and degraded maturity transparency
- Release workflow requires: version bump, validation, PR merge, tag/release publish, registry verification, smoke real

## Root Cause

Release publishing is a separate explicit step after feature PR merge.

## Solution
