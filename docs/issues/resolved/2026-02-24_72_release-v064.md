# Release v0.6.4

- **Date**: 2026-02-24
- **Issue**: #72
- **Status**: `done`
- **Branch**: `fix/2026-02-24-close-release-v064-issue`
- **Priority**: `medium`

## Problem

Main already includes merged changes from PR #68, but users still install `0.6.3` from PyPI/npm.

## Context

- Latest released version: `0.6.3`
- Main contains recommendation quality gate, deterministic scoring, and client-matrix E2E tests
- Publish is triggered by GitHub release tag (`v*`)

## Root Cause

No new version bump/tag exists after merging PR #68.

## Solution

1. Created release issue and dedicated bump branch.
2. Bumped patch version:
   - `pyproject.toml`: `0.6.3` -> `0.6.4`
   - `npm-wrapper/package.json`: `0.6.3` -> `0.6.4`
3. Opened and merged PR #73 (`Bump version to 0.6.4`).
4. Created GitHub release/tag `v0.6.4`.
5. Verified publication on both registries (PyPI and npm).

## Files Changed

- `docs/issues/2026-02-24_72_release-v064.md` — release tracking issue doc
- `pyproject.toml` — version bump to `0.6.4`
- `npm-wrapper/package.json` — version bump to `0.6.4`

## Verification

- [x] Version bumped in Python + npm wrapper
- [x] PR merged to main
- [x] GitHub release/tag `v0.6.4` created
- [x] PyPI and npm show `0.6.4`

Evidence:

- PR: `#73` (merged)
- Release: `https://github.com/felipestenzel/mcp-tap/releases/tag/v0.6.4`
- PyPI check: `uv run python -m pip index versions mcp-tap` -> `LATEST: 0.6.4`
- npm check: `npm view mcp-tap version` -> `0.6.4`
