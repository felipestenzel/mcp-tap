# Release v0.6.1

- **Date**: 2026-02-23
- **Status**: `done`
- **Branch**: `main` (direct commit — violates branch rule, see Lessons Learned)
- **Priority**: `medium`

## Problem

The fixes merged in PR #61 are ready, but users cannot install them via `uvx mcp-tap@...` or
`npx mcp-tap` until a new version is published.

## Context

- Current published version: `0.6.0`
- Release flow is tag-driven via `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (`v*` tags)
- PyPI version comes from `pyproject.toml`; npm wrapper version should stay aligned

## Root Cause

No new release/tag exists yet for the patch fixes after v0.6.0.

## Solution

Bumped version to `0.6.1` in `pyproject.toml` and `npm-wrapper/package.json`, bundled with the
`fix/2026-02-23-scan-http-polish` fixes. Release created via `gh release create v0.6.1`.

## Files Changed

- `pyproject.toml` — version 0.6.0 → 0.6.1
- `npm-wrapper/package.json` — version 0.6.0 → 0.6.1
- `docs/issues/2026-02-23_release-v061.md` — this file

## Verification

- [x] Tests pass: `pytest tests/` → 1232 passed
- [x] Linter passes: `ruff check src/ tests/ && ruff format --check src/ tests/`
- [x] Tag/release `v0.6.1` created on GitHub
- [ ] Verify PyPI + npm publish (`pip index versions mcp-tap`, `npm view mcp-tap version`)

## Lessons Learned

- The fixes and version bump were committed directly to `main` without a PR, violating the
  branch rule. Future patch releases must still go through a feature/fix branch + PR.
