# Release v0.6.5

- **Date**: 2026-02-24
- **Issue**: #77
- **Status**: `done`
- **Branch**: `fix/2026-02-24-close-release-v065-issue`
- **Priority**: `medium`

## Problem

Main includes changes after `v0.6.4`, but registries still expose `0.6.4` as latest.

## Context

- Latest published release before this work: `v0.6.4`
- New merged work includes issue tracking improvements around semantic intent rerank planning
- Publish flow is tag-driven via GitHub Release (`v*`)

## Root Cause

No version bump/tag was created after the latest merge.

## Solution

1. Created release issue and dedicated bump branch.
2. Bumped patch version:
   - `pyproject.toml`: `0.6.4` -> `0.6.5`
   - `npm-wrapper/package.json`: `0.6.4` -> `0.6.5`
3. Opened and merged PR #78 (`Bump version to 0.6.5`).
4. Created GitHub release/tag `v0.6.5`.
5. Verified publication on both registries (PyPI and npm).

## Files Changed

- `docs/issues/2026-02-24_77_release-v065.md` — release tracking issue doc
- `pyproject.toml` — version bump to `0.6.5`
- `npm-wrapper/package.json` — version bump to `0.6.5`

## Verification

- [x] Version bumped in Python + npm wrapper
- [x] Release PR merged to main
- [x] GitHub release/tag `v0.6.5` created
- [x] PyPI and npm show `0.6.5`

Evidence:

- PR: `#78` (merged)
- Release: `https://github.com/felipestenzel/mcp-tap/releases/tag/v0.6.5`
- PyPI check: `uv run python -m pip index versions mcp-tap` -> `LATEST: 0.6.5`
- npm check: `npm view mcp-tap version` -> `0.6.5`
