# Release v0.6.6

- **Date**: 2026-02-24
- **Issue**: #83
- **Status**: `done`
- **Branch**: `fix/2026-02-24-close-release-v066-issue`
- **Priority**: `high`

## Problem

The repository has merged feature work in PR #80 and PR #82, but no published release bundles
these changes yet.

## Context

- PR #80 (semantic intent rerank) is merged into main.
- PR #82 (official Python 3.14 support in CI/metadata) is merged into main.
- Latest published version is v0.6.5.

## Root Cause

Release cut/publish steps were not executed after merge completion.

## Solution

Completed release pipeline for v0.6.6:

1. Merged feature PRs into `main`:
   - #80 semantic intent rerank
   - #82 official Python 3.14 support
2. Opened and merged release bump PR #84:
   - `pyproject.toml` -> `0.6.6`
   - `npm-wrapper/package.json` -> `0.6.6`
3. Created GitHub release tag `v0.6.6`.
4. Verified publish workflow success:
   - `publish-pypi` success
   - `publish-npm` success
5. Verified registry availability:
   - PyPI latest `mcp-tap==0.6.6`
   - npm latest `mcp-tap@0.6.6`
6. Executed practical smoke using released package and live registries:
   - semantic query `search_servers(\"error monitoring\")` returned intent-ranked providers.

## Files Changed

- `pyproject.toml` — version bumped to `0.6.6`
- `npm-wrapper/package.json` — version bumped to `0.6.6`
- `docs/issues/2026-02-24_83_release-v066.md` — issue tracking doc

## Verification

- [x] Version bump committed and merged (`0.6.6`)
- [x] GitHub Release `v0.6.6` created
- [x] PyPI shows `mcp-tap==0.6.6`
- [x] npm shows `mcp-tap@0.6.6`
- [x] Practical smoke with `uvx mcp-tap@0.6.6` passes

Validation executed:
- `gh pr merge 80 --merge` -> merged
- `gh pr merge 82 --merge` -> merged
- `gh pr merge 84 --merge` -> merged
- `gh release create v0.6.6 --target main` -> published
- `gh run watch 22370149279` -> publish workflow passed
- `python3 -m pip index versions mcp-tap` -> `0.6.6` available
- `npm view mcp-tap version` -> `0.6.6`
- practical smoke:
  - `uv run --isolated --no-project --default-index https://pypi.org/simple --refresh --with mcp-tap==0.6.6 ...`
  - semantic results returned with `intent_match_score` and provider matches (`sentry`, `newrelic`, `datadog`)

## Lessons Learned

- Some `uvx` environments can lag on index resolution right after publish; forcing
  `--default-index https://pypi.org/simple --refresh` avoids stale resolution during
  immediate post-release smoke.
