# Release v0.6.4

- **Date**: 2026-02-24
- **Issue**: #72
- **Status**: `in_progress`
- **Branch**: `fix/2026-02-24-release-v064`
- **Priority**: `medium`

## Problem

Main already includes merged changes from PR #68, but users still install `0.6.3` from PyPI/npm.

## Context

- Latest released version: `0.6.3`
- Main contains recommendation quality gate, deterministic scoring, and client-matrix E2E tests
- Publish is triggered by GitHub release tag (`v*`)

## Root Cause

No new version bump/tag exists after merging PR #68.

## Solution

(Fill after implementation)

## Files Changed

- [ ] PR merged to main
- [ ] GitHub release/tag `v0.6.4` created
- [ ] PyPI and npm show `0.6.4`
