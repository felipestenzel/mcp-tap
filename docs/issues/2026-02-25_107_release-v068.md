# Release v0.6.8 (Cache Fallback + Configure Dry-Run)

- **Date**: 2026-02-25
- **Issue**: #107
- **Status**: `open`
- **Branch**: `fix/2026-02-25-release-v068`
- **Priority**: `high`

## Problem

Changes from PR #106 are merged in `main`, but no release has been cut yet. Users cannot install
these improvements from package registries.

## Context

- Last release is `v0.6.7`.
- PR #106 added:
  - search cache fallback metadata (`#104`)
  - `configure_server(dry_run=True)` preflight (`#105`)
- Release process requires version bump, validation, tag publish, and smoke.

## Root Cause

Release cadence depends on an explicit bump/tag workflow after merge.

## Solution

1. Bump versions to `0.6.8`.
2. Validate with lint + tests.
3. Open/merge release PR.
4. Publish tag `v0.6.8`.
5. Verify PyPI/npm availability and execute real smoke.
