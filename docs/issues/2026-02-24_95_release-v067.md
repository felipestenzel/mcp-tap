# Release v0.6.7

- **Date**: 2026-02-24
- **Issue**: #95
- **Status**: `in_progress`
- **Branch**: `fix/2026-02-24-release-v067`
- **Priority**: `high`

## Problem

After merging PRs #91, #92, #93, and #94, we need a clean release cut so users can install the
new capabilities via PyPI/npm and validate in a real smoke flow.

## Context

- Affected layers:
  - release metadata/versioning
  - publish pipeline (PyPI + npm)
- Current latest public release before this task: `v0.6.6`
- New merged scope includes semantic precision hardening, runtime version source-of-truth, client
  E2E matrix gate, and production feedback loop.

## Root Cause

Release was pending after merging the feature/fix PR batch.

## Solution

1. Bump project version to `0.6.7` in release metadata files.
2. Validate with lint/tests.
3. Merge release PR to `main`.
4. Push `v0.6.7` tag to trigger publish workflow.
5. Confirm publish jobs and run smoke from published version.

## Files Changed

- `pyproject.toml` — bump Python package version to `0.6.7`
- `npm-wrapper/package.json` — keep wrapper metadata aligned with release version
- `docs/issues/2026-02-24_95_release-v067.md` — release tracking

## Verification

- [x] Tests pass: `uv run pytest tests/ -q`
- [x] Linter passes: `uv run ruff check src/ tests/`
- [ ] Tag `v0.6.7` published successfully (PyPI + npm workflows green)
- [ ] Real smoke validates published version install/run
